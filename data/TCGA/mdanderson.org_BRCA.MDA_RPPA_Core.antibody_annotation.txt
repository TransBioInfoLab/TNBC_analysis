The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target."

In response to genotoxic stress, PARP-1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to a number of acceptor molecules including chromatin. PARP-1 recognizes DNA strand interruptions and can complex with RNA and negatively regulate transcription. Actinomycin D- and etoposide-dependent induction of caspases mediates cleavage of PARP-1 into a p89 fragment that traverses into the cytoplasm. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus is PARP-1-dependent and is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. PARP-1 deficiencies lead to chromosomal instability due to higher frequencies of chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to the efficient maintenance of genome integrity. PARP-2 is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of nuclear proteins. PARP-2 is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein which interacts with PARP-1. PARP-2 is present in actively dividing tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, heart and spleen."

In human PARP, the cleavage occurs between Asp214 and Gly215, which separates the PARP amino-terminal DNA binding domain (24 kDa) from the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (89 kDa). PARP helps cells to maintain their viability; cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis."

The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target."

The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target."

The carboxy-terminal region of eIF4G also contains serum-stimulated phosphorylation sites, including Ser1108, Ser1148, and Ser1192 (5). Phosphorylation at these sites is blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 and by the FRAP/mTOR inhibitor rapamycin."

The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target."

In response to genotoxic stress, PARP-1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to a number of acceptor molecules including chromatin. PARP-1 recognizes DNA strand interruptions and can complex with RNA and negatively regulate transcription. Actinomycin D- and etoposide-dependent induction of caspases mediates cleavage of PARP-1 into a p89 fragment that traverses into the cytoplasm. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus is PARP-1-dependent and is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. PARP-1 deficiencies lead to chromosomal instability due to higher frequencies of chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to the efficient maintenance of genome integrity. PARP-2 is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of nuclear proteins. PARP-2 is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein which interacts with PARP-1. PARP-2 is present in actively dividing tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, heart and spleen."

In human PARP, the cleavage occurs between Asp214 and Gly215, which separates the PARP amino-terminal DNA binding domain (24 kDa) from the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (89 kDa). PARP helps cells to maintain their viability; cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis."

The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target."

Two Erk and p38 MAPK phosphorylation sites in mouse Mnk1 (Thr197 and Thr202) are essential for Mnk1 kinase activity (3). The carboxy-terminal region of eIF4G also contains serum-stimulated phosphorylation sites, including Ser1108, Ser1148, and Ser1192 (5).

In response to genotoxic stress, PARP-1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to a number of acceptor molecules including chromatin. PARP-1 recognizes DNA strand interruptions and can complex with RNA and negatively regulate transcription. Actinomycin D- and etoposide-dependent induction of caspases mediates cleavage of PARP-1 into a p89 fragment that traverses into the cytoplasm. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus is PARP-1-dependent and is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. PARP-1 deficiencies lead to chromosomal instability due to higher frequencies of chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to the efficient maintenance of genome integrity. PARP-2 is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of nuclear proteins. PARP-2 is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein which interacts with PARP-1. PARP-2 is present in actively dividing tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, heart and spleen."

In human PARP, the cleavage occurs between Asp214 and Gly215, which separates the PARP amino-terminal DNA binding domain (24 kDa) from the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (89 kDa). PARP helps cells to maintain their viability; cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis."
